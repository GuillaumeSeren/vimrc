vimrc
=====
This is my vim configuration,
I use it for my daily usage coding / mail / irc / blog.

Terminal
========
I use vim in a terminal so please check my configuration, if you have
trouble on some strange remaping or maybe just open a issue.

Plugins
=======
As I use NeoBundle to manage the plugins, I distinct two categories (C):
* Defaults plugins (always loaded).
* Specifics plugins (lazy loaded on some case).

Dictionnaries
=============
Aside as the plugins the dictionnaries are not installed by NeoBundle,
so you have to download them yourself and put them in '~/.vim/spell',
you can find them, here (by default I use french & english):
http://wordlist.aspell.net/

Install
=======
```
# Clone this repos
$ git clone https://github.com/GuillaumeSeren/vimrc ~/.vim
# Launch vim and install everything
$ vim
```
