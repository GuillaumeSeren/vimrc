vimrc
=====
This is my vim configuration,
I use it for my daily usage mail / coding / blog.

Keyboard
========
I use the french dvorak «bépo» for my keyboard and I needed to change a lot of
the shorcut, good read is http://bepo.fr/wiki/Accueil.

Plugins
=======
As I use NeoBundle to manage the plugins, I distinct two categories (C):
* Defaults plugins (always loaded).
* Specifics plugins (lazy loaded on some case).

Install
=======
```
# Clone this repos
$ git clone https://github.com/GuillaumeSeren/vimrc ~/.vim
# Launch vim and install everything
$ vim
```
