vimrc
=====
This is my {neo,}vim configuration,
I use it for my daily usage coding / mail / note / blog.

Terminal
========
I use vim in a terminal so please check my configuration, if you have
trouble on some strange remaping or maybe just open a issue.

Plugins
=======
As I use VimPlug to manage the plugins, I distinct two categories (C):
* Defaults plugins (always loaded).
* Specifics plugins (lazy loaded on some case).

Install
=======
```
# Clone this repos
$ git clone https://github.com/GuillaumeSeren/vimrc ~/.vim
# Launch vim and install everything
$ vim
```
