  * dpkg-source will now clean up after a failed application of a quilt
    patch. Closes: #652970
    And it will display a message explaining the most likely cause of
    failure (patch applying with fuzz).
  * When dpkg-source regenerates the automatic patch (with formats "2.0"
    or "3.0 (quilt)") it will keep the current patch header to avoid
    losing changes made by the maintainer.
  * Modify dpkg-source --commit to auto-whitelist modified binary files.
    That way the same command can be used whatever kind of upstream files
    has been modified.
  * dpkg-source now supports a new option --no-unapply-patches to force
    patches to be kept applied after build (used by formats "2.0" and "3.0

  * Deprecate compressing .deb files with lzma, by making dpkg-deb issue a
    warning, as the format has several deficiencies that have been addressed
    by upstream in xz. Although unpacking will be kept being supported to
    handle existing lzma compressed .deb files.
  * Add alternative changelog formats documentation from the policy manual
    to dpkg-parsechangelog(1). Closes: #584141
  * Add MiNT support to ostable and triplettable.

    Closes: #580038
  * Switch start-stop-daemon(8) man page examples from /var/run to /run.
  * Do not obscure Dpkg::Source::Package ‘require’ errors with custom
    error message. Thanks to Thomas Adam <thomas.adam@smoothwall.net> and
    Jonathan Nieder <jrnieder@gmail.com>.
  * Add new Dpkg::Substvars::set_as_used() member function.
  * Rename Dpkg::Substvars no_warn() member function to mark_as_used(), keep
    the old name aliased to the new one producing a deprecation warning.
  * Add support for Build-Depends-Arch and Build-Conflicts-Arch fields, and
    a new -A option to dpkg-checkbuilddeps. Closes: #629480
    Thanks to Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>.
  * Add support for “none” as a valid dpkg-deb compression strategy value.
    Closes: #674711
  * Clarify in dpkg(1) that the «dpkg -l» example only lists installed
    packages, and that to list available packages «dpkg-query --load-avail»
    has to be used instead. Closes: #673305
  * Clarify also in the dpkg(1) man page (already present in the dpkg.cfg(5)

  * Refactor the file locking logic into a new Dpkg::File module, and move
    the libfile-fcntllock-perl dependency from dpkg-dev to libdpkg-perl.
  * Demote the libfile-fcntllock-perl Depends to a Recommends by falling back
    to use flock based locking, because it being an XS module makes building
    a new perl package bumping the perl ABI impossible, as both packages
    become uninstallable. Thanks to Dominic Hargreaves <dom@earth.li>.

  * Put an & before field_capitalize() calls in Dpkg::Control::Fields to
    fix a usage before declaration warning with perl 5.16. Closes: #676262
  * Do not warn in dpkg-divert on missing files list file for packages never
    installed before. Closes: #673518
  * Add support for liblzma to handle .xz and .lzma compressed files, and

    Pre-Depends from dpkg. Thanks to Jonathan Nieder <jrnieder@gmail.com>.

    Suggested by Peter Eisentraut <petere@debian.org>.
  * Document in dpkg-query(1) that commands producing multiple paragraphs
    will preserve the order of the packages specified on the argument list.
  * Change start-stop-daemon --exec on GNU/Hurd, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
    and Solaris to check for executables matching device and inode numbers
    instead of filenames.
  * Change start-stop-daemon --name on GNU/Hurd to check the process' argv[1]
    in addition to argv[0], to handle both binaries and interpreted scripts.
    Reported by Mats Erik Andersson <mats.andersson@gisladisker.se>.
  * Handle deb format versions as major.minor integers instead of strings or
    floats, the latter being susceptible to parsing errors depending on the
    current locale (although this was only affecting the old deb format).
  * Ignore the minor format version number for deb-split format, unifying
    the behaviour with the deb format.
  * Add support for an abitable containing arch attribute overrides.

  * Honour --disable-nls when the system lacks obstack support, by updating
    the obstack compat module from gnulib.
  * Link the libdpkg unit tests with libcompat and libintl, so that systems
    needing them will compile correctly.
  * Check for the presence of the strnlen declaration and correctly provide
    the compat one in case the systems lacks it.
  * Do not assume existence of paths on the build system in the test suite.
  * Do not fail to link dselect on MacOS X when using --disable-nls.
  * Remove versioned coreutils Pre-Depends from dpkg due to the ancient
    md5sum transition. Reported by Bill Allombert <ballombe@debian.org>.
    Closes: #643746
  * Change dpkg-architecture to only compute the requested variables. This:
    - Fixes the bootstrapping problem, as the dpkg build system only needs
      the host architecture, for which dpkg itself is not required.
    - Reduces the amount of work performed, including loading and parsing
      unnecessary table files or calling either of gcc or dpkg programs.
  * Improve error message in dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-gensymbols when
    debian/control does not have any package stanza. Closes: #642473
    Based on a patch by Kyle Willmon <kylewillmon@gmail.com>.

    Thanks to Matt Kraai <kraai@ftbfs.org>.
  * Return correct status on start-stop-daemon --status when using --pidfile.
  * Treat dpkg-deb compression level independently for each backend. This
    has the effect of changing the current behaviour for level 0 on all
    compressors except gzip.
  * Add new dpkg-deb -S option to specify the compression strategy. The only
    currently supported value is “extreme” for xz. Closes: #647915
  * Stop using brace expansion to install man pages by using dh_installman

  * Modify dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-distaddfile to grab a write lock
    on debian/control before updating debian/files to avoid simultaneous
    updates. Closes: #642608
    Add libfile-fcntllock-perl to dpkg-dev's Depends since we use this module

  * Update dpkg-gensymbols(1) to clarify that -e accepts shell patterns
    expansions and not regular expressions. And let dpkg-gensymbols output a
    warning when a pattern doesn't match any file. Closes: #649248
  * Add new option "-a <arch>" to dpkg-checkbuilddeps to check build

dpkg (1.16.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Dpkg::Deps: Implement new "reset" method and bump module version to 1.01
    due to this.
  * Improved description of --search in dpkg-query(1). Closes: #621066
    Thanks to Lars Buitinck <larsmans@gmail.com> for the patch.
  * Let update-alternatives fsync() its administrative files before
    moving them in place to avoid empty files with some filesystems.
    LP: #344019
  * Tighten the regexp used by dpkg-source to ignore the .pc directory of
    quilt. Thanks to Mike Hommey for noticing the problem.
  * Change behaviour of dpkg-source's --extend-diff-ignore to also
    extend the current diff-ignore if it has already been set.
  * Fix dependency checking code to consider a dependency on a virtual
    package provided by a package in triggers-pending status as satisfied.
  * Do not fail when encountering a pre-dependency in triggers-awaited state,
    instead process the awaited triggers. Closes: #526774
  * "any" no longer hides "all" in the Architecture field of a .dsc.
  * Fix dpkg --remove to really remove the triggers from the various
    internal files in /var/lib/dpkg/info/triggers/. Closes: #525160
  * Avoid a perl warning in dpkg-gensymbols when no symbols file has been
    generated (because it would have been empty). Closes: #626684
  * Re-enable the Package-List field but drop the Architecture column since we
    have no clear use case yet. It can always be added later on.
    Also drop the source line since it duplicates other fields.
    Closes: #619131
  * Add the extraction part of Dpkg::Source::Package to the supported API.
    Useful to extract source packages without having to depend on dpkg-source
    (and hence dpkg-dev).
  * Add the Dpkg::Vendor module to the supported API. Useful for lintian
    when dpkg-dev is absent.
  * Check presence of required parameters in dpkg-vendor. Closes: #628726
    Thanks to Niels Thykier <niels@thykier.net> for the patch.
  * Avoid a Perl warning in dpkg-buildflags when HOME is not set.
    Closes: #635467

    included in the generated source package) instead of
    debian/source/patch-header. Closes: #629582
  * Changed dpkg-source --after-build to automatically unapply patches that it
    has applied during --before-build.
  * Fix two possible causes for the assertion failure "pigp->trigpend_head".
    LP: #798793, #424358 Closes: #560251
  * Use "special" instead of "particular" to qualify the "3.0 (custom)" format
    in dpkg-source(1). Closes: #631435
  * Add some supplementary checks to ensure debian/control has the required
    fields. Closes: #631439
  * dpkg-gensymbols(1): document syntax of comments. Closes: #630996
  * Allow empty lines in symbols files to better delimit multiple libraries.
    Thanks to Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org> for the patch.
  * dpkg: if "prerm upgrade" fails when downgrading, do not try to run
    "prerm failed-upgrade" with the prerm of the oldest prerm, it can't work
    around a bug of a newer prerm anyway.
  * dpkg: support new "interest-noawait" and "activate-noawait" trigger
    directives.
  * dpkg-buildflags(1): make it clear that DEB_*_(SET|APPEND) environment
    variables are meant for users and should not be used by packages.

  * Reword the description of dpkg-source --before-build and --after-build
    to be clearer. Closes: #608260
  * dpkg-buildpackage no longer exports the compiler flags. Closes: #560070
    Packages must directly call dpkg-buildflags to retrieve them.
  * dpkg-buildflags supports a prepend command to modify the build
    flags. Particularly useful for package maintainers who don't want
    their supplementary flags to take precedence over user submitted
    flags.
  * Add new --dump action to dpkg-buildflags and make it the default action.
    Closes: #603435
  * dpkg-mergechangelogs now checks the return value of the close() call.
    Thanks to Niels Thykier <niels@thykier.net> for the patch. Closes: #633539
  * Similar changes to dpkg-shlibdeps and dpkg-gencontrol, also by Niels.
  * Fix update-alternatives to not remove a real file when dropping a
    symlink for a slave that's not provided by the new current choice.
    Closes: #633627
  * Improve dpkg-source's error message complaining about the lack
    of the upstream tarball. Closes: #634510

    /usr/share/dpkg/: default.mk, architecture.mk, buildflags.mk, pkg-info.mk,
    vendor.mk Closes: #606839
  * Fix the dpkg-divert test-suite to also skip test that would fail if run
    under root. Closes: #634961
  * Change merge conflict separators created by dpkg-mergechangelogs to match
    the usual norm of being composed of 7 characters. LP: #815700
  * With source format 2.0 and 3.0 (quilt), dpkg-source now fails by default
    when upstream changes have not been recorded in a quilt patch. The new
    --commit operation can be used to properly record the changes before-hand.
    LP: #797839
    And it fails before installing the automatic patch in debian/patches/
    Closes: #615899
  * dpkg-buildflags now supports "--export=configure" to output compilation
    flags on a single line with double quotes as delimiter of the various
    values. It also uses DEB_<flag>_MAINT_<op> to let the maintainer
    extend the build flags to use. Last but not least, it can now also strip
    options from the returned build flags.
  * Fix possible segfault of dpkg in findbreakcycle(). LP: #733414
  * dpkg-source now properly cleans up the temporary tarball generated for
    native formats in case of unexpected interruption. Closes: #631494
  * Fix simplification logic of union dependencies. Closes: #637564
  * Fix dpkg's handling of a hardlink pointing to a conffile. Closes: #638291
  * Add example of extend-diff-ignore's usage in dpkg-source(1).
    Closes: #640198
  * dpkg-buildflags now returns hardening flags by default. Closes: #489771

  * Do not allow versions starting with non-digit when doing strict parsing,
    warn otherwise.
  * Update dpkg(1) to note that --status-fd output does not contain newlines
    in error messages anymore (this was fixed in 1.15.0).
  * Add a new --status-logger option to dpkg, similar to --status-fd but
    instead invoke the command ourselves and feed the status information

  * Always warn when parsing any package control data which does not have
    an Architecture field except for status and status log files when

  * Implement new --unapply-patches option for dpkg-source with source formats
    2.0 and 3.0 (quilt) that unapplies the patches after a successful build.
    This option can be put in debian/source/local-options in the package VCS

  * Use __attribute__ keyword depending on compiler support, we avoid
    exposing the configure variable HAVE_C_ATTRIBUTE on installed headers.
  * Do not allow a --retry schedule in start-stop-daemon where forever is

  * Show dselect dependency/conflicts resolution screen again, by switching
    the code to use STL's min() and max() instead of preprocessor macros, to

    Based on a patch by Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>. Closes: #574816
  * Defer the fsync and rename for normal files in tar extraction so that
    it's done in one pass afterwards, to avoid massive I/O degradation due to

dpkg (1.15.6) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * debian/control: Add the accent on my first name.
  * Perl API cleanup:
    - rename Dpkg::Deps dump() methods into output([$fh]), overload string
      representation ("$dep") to provide the result of $dep->output()
    - prefix public functions in Dpkg::Deps with deps_ and export them
      by default
    - rename Dpkg::Source::Compressor in Dpkg::Compression::Process
    - rename Dpkg::Source::CompressedFile in Dpkg::Compression::FileHandle
      and completely redesign its API
    - update Dpkg::Compression's API to use compression_* functions
      instead of granting direct access to variables, integrate
      there management of default compression
    - introduce Dpkg::Interface::Storable and update many modules
      to make use of it
    - update Dpkg::BuildOptions to provide an object-oriented interface
    - update Dpkg::Checksums to provide an object-oriented interface
  * Drop debian-maintainers from Suggests since it's obsolete, the
    corresponding keyring is in debian-keyring.
  * Merge support of symbol patterns in dpkg-gensymbols. Thanks to
    Modestas Vainius for his work (see further for more details).
  * Accept filename with spaces and colon in the output of objdump.
    Required so that dpkg-shlibdeps support such files properly.
    Thanks to Raphaël Geissert for the patch. Closes: #565712
  * When unpacking a "3.0 (quilt)" source package, tell quilt where
    patches are (to be) stored. Requires quilt >= 0.48-5 to work.
    Closes: #557619
  * Fix update-alternatives to not try to reinstall an unknown alternative
    when the link group is broken, instead switch to the best choice in
    automatic mode. Closes: #566406
  * Don't return duplicate bug numbers in Launchpad-Bugs-Fixed:.
    Thanks to Brian Murray <brian@ubuntu.com> for the report
    and the patch. Closes: #569618
  * Add $VERSION numbers to all perl modules. Closes: #465256
    1.00 and higher means that the API should be stable
  * While parsing diff's output, accept any sentence that contains the word
    differ (as specified by POSIX) to identify that binary files could not be
    compared. Closes: #570008
  * dpkg-gencontrol does no longer accept arch-specific dependencies in
    arch: all packages. Closes: #560071
  * dpkg-gencontrol no longer warns if a substitution variable provided by -V
    is not used (the warning is meant to catch unused substitutions coming
    from the file, those are package specific with debhelper). Closes: #557133
  * dpkg-gencontrol now indicates which package is concerned by the substvars
    warning that it displays. Closes: #566837
  * dpkg-buildpackage now supports options --source-option=<opt> and
    --changes-option=<opt> to forward arbitrary options to dpkg-source and
    dpkg-genchanges respectively. Closes: #566230
  * The -T option of dpkg-{source,gencontrol,genchanges} can now be used
    multiple times to read substitution variables from multiple files.
    Closes: #363323
  * dpkg-source now supports an option --create-empty-orig in formats
    "2.0" and "3.0 (quilt)" to auto-create the main original tarball when
    there are supplementary tarballs. This makes it easier to bundle
    multiple software together. Closes: #554488
  * dpkg-source supports long option names --diff-ignore and --tar-ignore for
    -i and -I. A new option --extend-diff-ignore is introduced. Those options
    can thus now be used in debian/source/options.
  * Generate manual pages for perl modules.
  * Introduce the libdpkg-perl package and clarify its status in README.api.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.4 (no changes needed).
  * Drop unused lintian override for arch-dep-package-has-big-usr-share on
    dselect.
  * The rewritten Dpkg::Checksums deals properly with filenames with
    spaces. Closes: #572030
  * dpkg-source does no longer fallback to other source formats if the
    requested one is not usable. Closes: #557459
  * Modify dpkg-source to error out when it would apply patches containing
    insecure paths (with "/../") and also error out when it would apply a
    patch through a symlink. Those checks are required as patch will happily
    modify files outside of the target directory and unpacking a source package
    should not be able to have any side-effect outside of the target
    directory. Fixes CVE-2010-0396.
  * Also error out when the quilt series contains a path with "/../" as this
    can cause patch to create files outside of the source package due
    to the -B .pc/$path option that it gets.

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Handle argument parsing in dpkg-checkbuilddeps and dpkg-scanpackages
    in a way consistent with the rest of the tools.
  * Recognize --help in addition to -h in dpkg-checkbuilddeps.
  * Add a --version option to dpkg-checkbuilddeps.
  * Improve and mark more messages in writedb() to make translators lifes
    easier. Closes: #408525
  * Improve update-alternatives --display output to use two leading spaces
    for current link and slave information. Use single quotes for both “best”
    and the alternative it's pointing to. Closes: #549167
  * Refer to “half configured” instead of “failed config” in «dpkg-query -l»
    header and dselect package status printing for consistency.
  * Make “dpkg-statoverride --quiet” actually do something, and quiesce
    most of the inoquous warning messages. Closes: #403211
  * Make “dpkg-statoverride --update --add” fail if it cannot update the
    mode and owner of the file. This would fail later on when dpkg itself
    applies the overrides, so better to signal this earlier.
  * Add sparc64 to cputable. Thanks to Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>.
    Closes: #560010
  * Do not allow diverting a file to itself, which makes the file to get
    removed. Closes: #312206
  * Make the check for duplicate fields in a stanza in libdpkg actually work,
    which now makes it fatal, as was intended originally. This should not
    cause problems for anything using dpkg-dev to build packages as those
    are already fatal on that case.
  * Add new deb-split(5) man page.
  * Fix misspellings of “explicitly” all over the place.
  * Normalize ar member names when reading (removing trailing spaces and
    slash), this allows deb-split packages be created with GNU ar.
  * Validate compression level on dpkg-deb argument parsing.
  * Fix error handling, clean up and refactor compression code.
    Thanks to Jonathan Nieder for several of the patches.
  * Do not print unambiguous epoch on dpkg file overwrite error.
  * Rename Dpkg::IPC::fork_and_exec() to Dpkg::IPC::spawn().
  * Change dpkg-dev to Depend on perl instead of perl5 and perl-modules.
  * Fix small memory leaks related to scandir() in dpkg-deb and libdpkg.
  * Fix dpkg-query and dpkg-trigger to actually print a version on --version.
  * Always spawn a new shell on conffile prompt, instead of supporting
    self backgrounding, remove DPKG_NO_TSTP environment variable support.
    Closes: #38334
  * Set DPKG_SHELL_REASON, DPKG_CONFFILE_OLD and DPKG_CONFFILE_NEW environment
    variables when spawning a shell for conffile examination. Closes: #60329
    Thanks to Daniel Martin <Daniel.Martin@jhu.edu> for the idea.
  * Add support for disabling update-alternatives at configure time using
    --without-update-alternatives.
  * Add support for disabling install-info at configure time using
    --without-install-info.
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Use Debian instead of ‘Debian GNU/Linux’ when referring to the
    distribution.
  * On dpkg --no-act with --install, --unpack or --record-avail, and
    dpkg-deb --info or --field use mkdtemp() to create a temporary directory
    instead of insecure tempnam() or tmpnam() functions.
  * Remove --license and --licence options from tools.
  * Securely remove newly installed files when rolling-back a failed unpack.
  * Change default lzma compression level from 9 to 6.
    Thanks to Jonathan Nieder for the initial patch.
  * Add support for xz compressed data.tar member of binary packages. Add
    xz-utils to dpkg's Pre-Depends. Closes: #542160
    Thanks to Jonathan Nieder for the initial patch.
  * Use xz command to handle lzma compressed files in dpkg and dpkg-dev.
    This removes the lzma package from both dpkg and dpkg-dev dependencies.
  * Do not set PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR in dpkg-buildpackage when cross-building.
    The proper solution to this is to let the build system choose the
    appropriate pkg-config binary for the build or host system in the same
    way pkg.m4 is handling it now. Closes: #551118
  * Dynamically link against all external libraries. This includes libbz2
    and zlib for dpkg-deb and and libselinux for dpkg on GNU/Linux.
  * Mark the libdpkg.a API as volatile and require any possible users to set
    LIBDPKG_VOLATILE_API to acknowledge that fact.
  * Add a new libdpkg-dev package with the headers and the static library,
    although its API should be considered volatile.
  * Reorganize the doc contents that goes into each package:
    - README.multicd only in dselect.
    - README.api only in development packages, dpkg-dev and libdpkg-dev.
    - triggers.txt only in dpkg-dev.
  * Move source.lintian-overrides to debian/source/lintian-overrides.
  * Switch SE Linux support to explicitly set path context. This fixes the
    mislabeling of files under <admindir> on conffile extraction or on unpack
    errors, due to improper default context restoration. Closes: #498438
  * Use FIEMAP when available (on Linux based systems) to sort the .list
    files loading order. With a cold cache it improves up to a 70%.
    Thanks to Morten Hustveit <morten@debian.org>.
  * When FIEMAP is not available use posix_fadvise() to start preloading the
    .list files before loading them. With a cold cache it improves up to 40%.
    Thanks to Stefan Fritsch <sf@sfritsch.de>. Closes: #557560
  * Call fsync(2) after writing files on disk, to get the atomicity
    guarantees when doing rename(2). Based on a patch by
    Jean-Baptiste Lallement <jeanbaptiste.lallement@gmail.com>.
    Closes: #430958
  * Call fsync(2) on database directories after creating, renaming or
    unlinking files, to guarantee the new file entry is correctly listed
    in the directory. Base on a patch by
    Jean-Baptiste Lallement <jeanbaptiste.lallement@gmail.com>.
  * Document in the man page the effects of setting TMPDIR for dpkg and
    dpkg-deb, HOME for dselect and dpkg and PAGER for dpkg. Closes: #572836
  * Document the exit codes for dpkg-query. Closes: #571798
  * Document “dpkg-query -l” abbreviated state information in the man page.
    Based on a patch by Marc-Jano Knopp <pub_br_debian.org@marc-jano.de>.
    Closes: #383869
  * Honour LINGUAS environment variable when installing translated man pages.
  * Allow disabling at configure time Unicode ncurses support for dselect.
    Based on a patch by Yuri Vasilevski <yvasilev@gentoo.org>.

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * Implement symbol patterns (Closes: #563752). From now on, it is possible to
    match multiple symbols with a single entry in the symbol file template.
    While the concept is not new (wildcards also match multiple symbols),
    patterns cover much more ground and are a lot more flexible. Together with
    the framework, 3 basic pattern types are supported:
    - c++ - matching C++ symbols by their demangled name (as emitted by
      c++filt);
    - symver - matching by symbol version. It replaces the wildcards feature
      which is still supported for backwards compatibility but is reimplemented
      on top of the new framework;
    - regex - matching symbol names with perl regular expression.
    Basic patterns may be combined where it makes sense.
  * As a positive side effect of the new symbol patterns implementation,
    patterns are now treated like normal symbols whenever possible, e.g. a
    pattern is MISSING if it does not match anything. As a result,
    dpkg-gensymbols is now able to detect NEW/MISSING symbols when patterns are
    present in the symbol file (Closes: #541464). Please note, however, that
    there is no way to detect symbol changes in the pattern match sets.
  * Add source version to the dpkg-gensymbols diff label, reformat it according
    to the rules of dpkg-name.
  * Add -a<arch> option to dpkg-gensymbols.
  * Add -q option to dpkg-gensymbols. -c0 will never fail but still generate a
    diff. Use -c0 -q to keep dpkg-gensymbols completely quiet as before
    (Closes: #568228).

  [ Jonathan Nieder ]
  * Fix a file handle leak in “dpkg-deb --info”. Thanks to Raphael Geissert
    for the report and patch.

  [ Helge Kreutzmann ]
  * Add dpkg-gensymbols.1 to the translatable man page set.

dpkg (1.15.5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix Dpkg::Index::get() and remove(). Thanks to Roderich Schupp
    <roderich.schupp@googlemail.com> for the patch. Closes: #558595
  * Modify implementation of "3.0 (quilt)" source format to not be
    behave differently depending on whether quilt is installed or not.
    The option --without-quilt is thus gone and dpkg-source creates
    and relies on the .pc directory to know whether patches are applied
    or not. Closes: #557667
  * Add new dpkg-source option --single-debian-patch supported by the source
    format "3.0 (quilt)" so that it behaves more like 1.0 and its single diff
    that is constantly updated with all upstream changes. Useful if the
    workflow is VCS based and can't generate a full patch set.
  * dpkg-source now uses debian/source/patch-header as header of the automatic
    Debian patch in format "3.0 (quilt)".

dpkg (1.15.5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Avoid usage of IO::String in dpkg-scanpackages, rely on Dpkg::IPC
    instead to directly get a pipe file descriptor. Closes: #557013
  * Put "3.0 (quilt)" in the default list of formats tried by dpkg-source
    after "1.0" and before "3.0 (native)".
  * Let dpkg-source fail if several upstream orig.tar files are available
    (using different compression scheme) since we don't know which one
    to use.
  * Add missing "use Dpkg::Gettext" in Dpkg::Changelog::Entry::Debian.
    Closes: #557668
  * When building "3.0 (quilt)" source packages, use QUILT_PATCH_OPTS="-t -F 0
    -N -u -V never -g0" so that quilt is as strict as dpkg-source's internal
    implementation of quilt. Closes: #557664, #558233
  * Before accepting to build a 3.0 (quilt) source packages, ensure that
    debian/patches is a directory (or non-existing) and that
    debian/patches/series is a file (or non-existing). Closes: #557618
  * Dpkg::IPC::fork_and_exec() now includes the changed environment
    variables in the default error message displayed when the sub-process
    fails.

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Verify that the alternative used in update-alternatives --set has been
    registered instead of failing with an undefined value in the slave

  * Update list of binaries dpkg checks on the PATH.
    - Remove install-info, now a wrapper that will disappear soonish.
    - Add programs used by dpkg itself: sh, rm, find, tar and dpkg-deb.
  * Check and warn on duplicate conffiles in dpkg-deb. Closes: #131633
  * Make the upstream build system silent by default with automake 1.11 or
    newer, and always verbose when building the Debian packages.
  * Fix small leak when parsing ‘--ignore-depends’ option values.
  * Define compatibility WCOREDUMP only if the system does not have it.
  * When start-stop-daemon fails to set the io scheduling warn instead of
    finishing fatally. Closes: #553580
  * Update md5 file paths in debian/copyright.
    Thanks to Jonathan Nieder <jrnieder@gmail.com>.
  * On ‘dpkg-trigger --help’ print the default admindir instead of the one

  * Abort on configure if the required C99 extensions are not supported.
  * Add C coding style document.
  * Make dpkg as strict as dpkg-statoverride on input when validating the
    parsed data from the statdb.
  * Rewrite dpkg-statoverride in C.
  * Use C99 snprintf function family semantics to avoid having to call them
    in a loop to grow the varbuf buffer. This should reduce memory usage and
    be slightly faster on varbufprintf calls.
  * Use the size from stat to allocate the buffers for readlink, instead of
    indefinitely calling readlink and growing the buffer. This should reduce
    memory usage when handling lots of symlinks, and be slightly faster.
  * Rework varbuf api to avoid increasing buffers indefinitely when adding
    content to them, regardless of space being already available.
  * Fix build macros to allow start-stop-deaemon to use TIOCNOTTY.
  * Generate the autoconf version from git to make it easier to see when a
    snapshot version is being used.
  * Add infrastructure for doxygen, for now not installed anywhere.
  * Allow overriding the pkg-config path to ease cross-compilation.

    that /etc/dpkg/origins/default exists. Closes: #545274
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes needed).
  * Major changes to the perl API:
    - Dpkg::Control is now Dpkg::Control::Info
    - Dpkg::Cdata is gone and is replaced by a new Dpkg::Control
    - Dpkg::Control::Fields contains authoritative information
      about fields allowed in various types of control information
      (and can be customized by each vendor). It also integrates
      information that was previously available through Dpkg::Deps.
    - Dpkg::Changelog has been split in multiple modules and largely
      modified to offer an interface that is now more in line with the
      other modules.
  * All dpkg-* perl programs that work with control information have been
    updated to use the new Dpkg::Control interface.
    In this process, dpkg-scanpackages has been fixed to not skip non-standard
    fields. Closes: #494136

  * Add new option --print-format to dpkg-source to be able to know by advance
    the source format that would be used during a build.
  * Modify dpkg-source -b to use default build options from
    debian/source/options. Thus it's now possible to have sticky options, for
    example for the choice of a compression method (--compression=<comp>).
  * dpkg-source outputs the list of upstream files modified by the diff.gz
    (applies only to source packages using format 1.0). Closes: #482166
    It also recommends usage of 3.0 (quilt) format during dpkg-source -b if it

dpkg (1.15.4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Call _g instead of g_ in dpkg-name.
  * Fix inverted logic when deciding to assume the architecture in dpkg-name
    when the package didn't have such field.
  * Do not take into account Revision and Package_Revision fields in dpkg-name
    and dpkg-scanpackages as they have been handled already by “dpkg-deb -I”.
  * Switch dpkg-scansources to use Dpkg::Cdata instead of duplicating the
    .dsc parsing code. As a side effect it now handles properly bogus files.
  * Do not remap obsolete fields in dpkg-scanpackages as they have been
    handled already by “dpkg-deb -I”.
  * Properly mark packages being purged for disappearance from the database.
    This will make the status database not be left behind with traces of old
    not-installed packages. Closes: #472208
  * On parse mark not-installed leftover packages for automatic removal from
    the database on next dump. This obsoletes the --forget-old-unavail option,
    thus making it now a no-op. Closes: #33394, #429262
  * Document “hold” under package selection states instead of flags in dpkg(1).
  * Remove trailing ‘/’ and ‘/.’ from the directory name to be used as the
    package name on “dpkg-deb -b”. Closes: #218018, #373602
  * Remove obsolete ‘hold’ and ‘hold-reinstreq’ internal status flags.
  * Add fakeroot to dpkg-dev Recommends. Closes: #536821
  * Fix an always false test when trying to decide which package to deselect
    to resolve a dependency problem in dselect.
  * Add uClibc Linux support to ostable and triplettable. Closes: #455501
  * Add uClinux support to ostable and triplettable.
    Thanks to Simon Richter <sjr@debian.org>.
  * When aborting due to file conflicts print the version of the conflicted
    package. Closes: #540019
  * Remove double slash in database path visible to the user in some error
    conditions.
  * Stop matching sparc64-*-* GNU triplets with sparc Debian architecture.
  * Add support for config.d style directories in dpkg and dselect,
    (/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d and /etc/dpkg/dselect.cfg.d respectively).
  * Define DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_ARCH on the maintainer script environment to the
    architecture the package got built for.
  * Document DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE maintainer script environment variable
    in dpkg man page.
  * Document DPKG_RUNNING_VERSION maintainer script environment variable
    in dpkg man page.
  * Change po4a usage to not create unwanted changes depending if doing out or
    in-tree builds.
  * Use po4a “--previous” support when updating the man pages.
    Suggested by Christian Perrier <bubulle@debian.org>.
  * On configuration error print file name and line number.
  * Allow quoting values in configuration file options.
  * Add new --pre-invoke and --post-invoke hooks in dpkg.
  * Add new --control-path command to dpkg-query.
  * Use ohshit on bad version syntax in --compare-versions.
  * Add Multi-Arch to the list of known binary package fields for dpkg-dev.
    Thanks to Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>.

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Replace install-info by a wrapper around GNU's install-info. The wrapper
    will be dropped in squeeze+1. dpkg now Breaks: old versions of
    info-browsers that do not depend on the new install-info package
    that provides the real functionality. Closes: #9771, #523980
    See http://wiki.debian.org/Transitions/DpkgToGnuInstallInfo for details.
  * Fix dpkg's preinst in case /var/lib/dpkg/alternatives contains unexpected
    sub-directories. Closes: #535138
    And also when one of the file doesn't contain correct alternatives
    information (improper number of lines). Closes: #537558
  * Upgrade Standards-Version to 3.8.2 (no changes).
  * Update deb-substvars(5) to list fields that do not support substvars.
    Closes: #535353
  * Fix dpkg-parsechangelog to include all entries with -v0 parameter.
    Closes: #537800
  * Fix update-alternatives to mention the correct slave link that can't
    be installed due to a conflicting file instead of quoting the master link.
  * Add support for extra override file in dpkg-scanpackages. Thanks to Robert
    Millan for the patch. Closes: #537559
  * Add support for extra override file in dpkg-scansources.
  * Document format of extra override file in a new manual page
    deb-extra-override(5).
  * Update sample in dpkg-gensymbols(1) to give an accurate listing of
    64 bit arches. Thanks to Julien Cristau for the patch. Closes: #540382
  * Create /etc/cron.daily/dpkg to handle the backup of
    /var/lib/dpkg/status in /var/backups. This is taken out of the cron
    package and need no conflicts/breaks as the code does nothing if
    the current status file is already backuped. Thanks to Leo 'costela'
    Antunes <costela@debian.org> for the patch. Closes: #541412
  * Change behaviour of dpkg --merge-avail to not update a package's
    information if the version provided is older than the one already listed
    in the available file. Thanks to Ian Jackson
    <ian@davenant.greenend.org.uk> for the patch. Closes: #496114
  * dpkg-architecture can now export DEB_{HOST,BUILD}_ARCH_{BITS,ENDIAN}
    (pointer size and endianness):
    - cputable (in dpkg) modified to contain those information
    - dpkg-dev depends on dpkg (>= 1.15.4) to ensure that we have an updated
      cputable (and so that a versioned build-dependency on dpkg-dev is enough
      to use this new feature)
    Closes: #531307
  * Split overly long Binary: field values over multiple lines. This is
    allowed since policy 3.8.3. Closes: #494714
  * Improve performance of dpkg-shlibdeps by caching minimal version
    associated to each library in Dpkg::Shlib::SymbolFile. Thanks to
    Jiří Paleček <jpalecek@web.de> for the patch.
  * Slightly improve dpkg-source(1) by giving the section name that we're
    referring to. Closes: #544037
  * Fix translation error in German manpage of dpkg-buildpackage. Thanks
    to Joachim Breitner <nomeata@debian.org>. Closes: #541829

  * Use default compressor values in dpkg-source from Dpkg::Source::Compressor.
  * Fix dpkg-scanpackages to properly detect spurious overrides.
  * Rewrite dpkg-name in perl.
  * Do not close already closed files in some error conditions in libdpkg.

  * Explicitly pass field argument to Dpkg::ErrorHandling::unknown().
  * Move unknown() from Dpkg::ErrorHandling to Dpkg::Fields.

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Unset TAR_OPTIONS when creating/extracting tar archives for source
    packages. Closes: #530860
  * Add cleanup of all invalid (master) alternatives in preinst script.
    Closes: #530633, #531611, #532739, #521760
  * Let update-alternatives fix a manual alternative with a dangling symlink
    by switching it to automatic mode. Closes: #529999

    Andersson <avtobiff@gmail.com>. Closes: #532769
  * Fix English mistake (“as you request” → “as you requested”) in several
    places. Thanks to David Stansby for the patch. Closes: #533171
  * Support tags before symbols in symbols file contained in source packages.
    The first two tags are "optional" (use it to not fail if the symbol might
    disappear from the library without breaking the ABI) and "arch" to
    restrict the set of architectures where the symbol is supposed to exist.
    Thanks to Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu> for the patch.
    See dpkg-gensymbols(1) for more information. Closes: #521551
  * Do not include #MISSING lines in symbols files integrated in binary
    packages. Closes: #526251
  * Assume an implicit version of "Base" for all unversioned symbols
    that are merged into a SymbolFile. Closes: #533181
  * Add new tag "ignore-blacklist" to force-include symbols which are
    normally blacklisted. This can be useful for libgcc to include symbols
    that the toolchain allows to be shared but that are often static (and
    hence are blacklisted for this reason). Closes: #533642
  * In dpkg-source, explicitly pass --keyring ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg to
    gpgv as it does not use it if other --keyring parameters are given.
    Closes: #530769
  * In dpkg-vendor, allow to use dashes instead of spaces in vendor
    filenames. Closes: #532222
  * Skip dpkg-genchanges' warning about lower version numbers for backports
    (recognized by ~bpo or ~vola in their version number). Closes: #525115
  * Support all checksum algorithms in dpkg-scanpackages/dpkg-scansources.
    Closes: #533828
  * Fix dependency parsing code in Dpkg::Deps to not accept "foo\nbar"
    even if foo is valid. Closes: #534464

dpkg (1.15.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Fix dpkg-genchanges to not include the additional upstream tarballs
    when they are not desired (specific to source packages using format 3.0
    quilt).
  * Call quilt only once to apply all patches instead of once per patch
    when building 3.0 (quilt) source packages. Closes: #518453
  * Fix dpkg-shlibdeps so that it works again when analyzing binaries
    outside of package's directory. Closes: #518687
  * Modify dpkg-shlibdeps to let shlibs.local override symbols files too.
  * Drop support of debian/control's “Format” field used by dpkg-source while
    it's not too late. Instead debian/source/format should be used to indicate
    the desired source package format.
  * Update deb-triggers(5) and dpkg-trigger(1) to add a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/dpkg/triggers.txt.gz. Closes: #519717
  * Avoid perl warnings in dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-genchanges when the
    Architecture field is missing in a binary package. Closes: #510282
  * Modify Dpkg::Version::check_version() to not die by default.
    Closes: #510615
  * dpkg-source now ignores all possible vi swap file extensions (and not
    only .swp). The corresponding exclude pattern for -I also got tightened to
    only catch filenames starting with a dot. Closes: #515540
  * dpkg-gencontrol displays a better error message when an ORed dependency
    is used in a union field like Conflicts, Replaces or Breaks.
    Closes: #489238
  * dpkg-source's signature check is now done with gpgv if possible and
    timeouts if not completed within 10 seconds. Closes: #490929
    When using gpg, use --no-default-keyring to be consistent with gpgv's
    behaviour to not use the user's keyring. Closes: #440841
  * Update dpkg-dev dependencies: Closes: #472942
    - Move gnupg to Recommends. It's needed to sign .dsc and .changes.
    - Add gpgv to Recommends. Useful to check signatures of extracted packages.
    - Add debian-maintainers to Suggests. Together with debian-keyring they
    contain all the GPG keys required to verify official Debian packages.
  * Drop /etc/dpkg/origins as it's taken over by base-files (see #487437).
  * Fix dpkg-shlibdeps to properly initialize a symbol-based dependency
    even when some symbols are associated with a (fake) version "0". Such a
    version means that the symbol has always existed in all versions of the
    package.
  * When dpkg delegates to dpkg-query or dpkg-deb to do the actual work, add
    the "--" marker to explicitly document the end of options so that
    arguments starting with a dash are not interpreted as options.
    Closes: #293163

  * dpkg now correctly refuses empty parameters when an integer value is
    wanted. Closes: #386197 Based on a patch by Bill Allombert.

    Thanks to Jonathan Gibert. Closes: #522032
  * Fix dpkg-source to not die when uncompressor processes are killed by
    SIGPIPE due to tar closing the pipe without exhausting all the data
    available. Closes: #523329
  * dpkg-gencontrol now handles properly (empty) dependencies which contain
    only spaces. Closes: #522787
  * dpkg-source now accepts additional tarballs (in format "3.0 (quilt)")
    with a "component" name containing dashes. Closes: #524376
  * Fix dpkg-source to not complain on binary files that are ignored and are
    not going to be included in the debian tarball of a "3.0 (quilt)" source
    package. Closes: #524375
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1 (no change required).
  * Do not store usernames and group names in tarballs created by dpkg-source,
    they are anyway ignored at unpack time. Closes: #523184
  * Fix update-alternatives to not remove real files installed in place of
    an alternative link when the corresponding alternative is fully removed.
    Closes: #526538
  * Add a new dpkg-vendor tool to query vendor information stored in
    /etc/dpkg/origins. It can be used in debian/rules to enable different
    behaviour depending on the current vendor at the time of the build.
    Closes: #498380
    Modify dpkg-buildpackage to not set the DEB_VENDOR environment variable,
    packages should use the dpkg-vendor program instead.
  * Ensure that the automatic patch created in format "3.0 (quilt)" is always
    well registered with quilt even when it's updated by a new call to
    dpkg-source. Thanks to Goswin von Brederlow for the initial patch.
    Closes: #525858
  * Do not update/create debian/patches/.dpkg-source-applied during build,
    it's only meant to document what patches have been applied at extraction
    time. Closes: #525835
  * Let dpkg-buildpackage add the missing execute right on debian/rules if
    needed. Display a warning when it happens. Closes: #499088
  * Allow to combine -nc and -S in dpkg-buildpackage but display a warning
    saying that it's not advised. Closes: #304404
  * Let dpkg-buildpackage error out with subprocerr() when dpkg-checkbuilddeps
    is interrupted/killed by a signal. Closes: #498734
  * Fix dpkg-buildpackage/dpkg-genchanges to properly interpret option -v0.

  * Improves how dpkg-parsechangelog handles non-existing versions
    in its --since, --until, --to, --from options. Approximate the intent

  * Enhance dpkg-shlibdeps' error message when a library can't be found to
    include the ELF format of the desired library. Closes: #474671
  * dpkg-gensymbols now refuses empty values for the the -v -P and -e
    parameters.
  * Update dpkg(1) to refer to conffile whenever we speak of configuration
    file handled by dpkg. Thus harmonize vocabulary with the policy. Thanks
    to Helge Kreutzmann <debian@helgefjell.de>. Closes: #381219
  * Improve error message stating that dpkg is unable to create a file so that
    it also refers to the real filename instead of the non-diverted name only.
    Thanks to Daniel Hahler for the patch. Closes: #457135
  * dpkg-gencontrol can now again read the control file from its standard
    input with "-c-". Closes: #465340
  * Add DEB_VENDOR environment variable in the build environment to be able
    to change behaviour dynamically depending on the vendor of the current
    system (or target system when the user overrides DEB_VENDOR by setting
    it himself). Closes: #457371
  * dpkg-shlibdeps give less strong warnings for symbols not found in NEEDED
    libraries when the shared library is a non-public directory and is likely
    to be a plugin. Closes: #481165
  * Clarify list of packages displayed by dpkg --get-selections and
    dpkg-query -l. Thanks to Jidanni. Closes: #487455
  * Document -A option in dpkg-buildpackage(1). Closes: #482834

  * Optimize dpkg-shlibdeps by caching parsed symbols files and
    objdump objects. Thanks to Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu> for the

  * Add new framework to hook vendor-specific logic (see
    module Dpkg::Vendor::Default).

    changelogs and a safety-check for Maintainer fields of forked packages
    (launched during source build). Closes: #426752, #499924
  * Improve behaviour of update-alternatives --config. Thanks to
    Osamu Aoki <osamu@debian.org> for the initial patch. We can know
    select between manual and auto in --config and --all. Closes: #392430
  * Fix update-alternatives to not switch to manual mode an alternative
    with a broken symlink (instead let the current action fix it).
    Also ensure that a message is displayed by default when such a switch is
    made. Closes: #141325, #87677
  * Fix update-alternatives' logic to rename files. It failed to ignore errors
    in some cases where it wanted to when the source file didn't exist.
    Closes: #99870
    This also makes update-alternatives less noisy when this happens since we
    don't call mv when we know that it's going to fail.
    Closes: #98822
  * Properly remove inappropriate slave links in update-alternatives even when
    we switch to manual mode with --set or --config. Closes: #388313
  * Modify update-alternatives to always remove the alternative group when the
    last alternative is removed (even in manual mode).
  * Ensure that update-alternative --install fix the links if the alternative
    installed is the one currently selected. Closes: #100135
  * Let update-alternatives deal with empty files in its administrative
    directory by ignoring them. Closes: #457863
  * Add new --target and --as-root options to dpkg-buildpackage to call
    any debian/rules target with the proper build environment.
    Closes: #477916
  * Move update-alternatives, dpkg-divert and dpkg-statoverride to /usr/bin
    but keep compatibility symlinks in /usr/sbin for the squeeze release
    until all maintainer scripts are fixed (see
    http://lintian.debian.org/tags/command-with-path-in-maintainer-script.html).
    Closes: #216606
  * Use dh_lintian to install lintian overrides. Build-Depends on debhelper
    (>= 6.0.7) for this. Update debhelper compatibility level to 6 at the same
    time.
  * Drop cleanup-info script.
  * Reset umask to 0022 in dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-gensymbols to ensure that
    files created in the DEBIAN directory have sane permissions.
    Closes: #516481
  * Rewrite update-alternatives (so that we can understand it again) and
    implement new features on top of it:
    - the --config output is now sorted. Closes: #437060
    - it now logs information to /var/log/dpkg.log. Closes: #445270
    - it forbids reusing master alternative as slave and vice-versa.
      Closes: #342566
    - it forbids reusing alternative links managed by other alternatives
    - new sanity checks on --install parameters. Closes: #423176
    - install slave link only if the corresponding slave file is available.
      Closes: #143701
    - new option --get-selections to export the configuration of all
      alternatives. It's a simple way to discover the name of all available
      alternatives. Closes: #273406, #392429
    - new option --set-selections to reconfigure a set of alternatives in
      a single command.
  * Document in update-alternatives(8) how one can repair all broken
    alternatives with a single command. Closes: #250258, #395556
  * Modify dpkg-gensymbols to replace #PACKAGE# on the fly while installing
    symbols files so that package having libraries whose name varies between
    architectures do not need to hardcode the package name. Closes: #517264

  * When dpkg-source builds a source package of Format: 2.0 or 3.0 (quilt) it
    applies the patches before the build if
    debian/patches/.dpkg-source-applied doesn't exist. This file is created
    during extraction if patches are applied, and is auto-excluded from the
    debian tarball. This enables on-the-fly conversion of source packages from
    Format: 1.0 to Format: 3.0 (quilt) without manual intervention of the
    user. This feature can be disabled with the option --no-preparation.
  * The dpkg-source option --skip-patches disables application of patches
    during extraction of source packages using Format: 2.0 or Format: 3.0
    (quilt).
  * Ensure the Files field is last in *.dsc and *.changes. This is a
    work-around for some braindead dsc parsers (dupload and sbuild for
    instance, see #473518 and #470440).
  * Initialize dependencies for libraries having symbols files with the
    smallest minimal version listed in the symbols file instead of using

  * Replace strdup plus error checking usage with a new m_strdup function.
    Closes: #379028
  * Add new keybinding in dselect to restore all selections back to
    whatever's currently installed. Closes: #151540
    Thanks to Colin Watson.
  * Use system timersub and fix timeval normalization in multiplication in
    start-stop-daemon. Thanks to Andreas Påhlsson. Closes: #462225
  * Cosmetic fixes to start-stop-daemon output and man page. Document that
    --chuid will change the group even if it has not been specified. Add
    EXIT STATUS and EXAMPLE sections to man page. Thanks to Justin Pryzby.
  * Add Raphaël Hertzog to Uploaders, and remove Brendan O'Dea and
    Christian Perrier with their permission.
  * Use functions from libcompat when those are not provided by the system.
    - Add strnlen to libcompat.
    - Link programs against libcompat which provides obstack. Closes: #142042
  * Change dpkg-gencontrol to not output the Homapage field on udeb.
  * Reintroduce 'no-debsig' back in dpkg.cfg to avoid failing to install any
    package when debsig-verify is installed. Closes: #311843
  * Fix some small memory leaks. Closes: #469520
    Thanks to Sean Finney.
  * Correct broken dselect logic for self-conflicting packages.
    Thanks to Ian Jackson.
  * Implement 'Breaks' properly in dselect. Closes: #448946
    Thanks to Ian Jackson.
  * Fix erroneous description of Breaks in dselect output.
    Thanks to Ian Jackson.
  * Allow compilation with --disable-nls on systems without libintl.h where
    a non glibc claims to be glibc. Closes: #465420
  * Fix crash when a .deb file becomes unreadable while dpkg is starting.
    Thanks to Ian Jackson. Closes: #255882
  * Few file descriptor cleanup and error handling fixes.
    Thanks to Ian Jackson. Closes: #443338
  * Move test suite invocation to a new check target in debian/rules.
  * Add support for nocheck DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS in debian/rules, so that the
    dpkg test suite can be skept if desired.
  * Improve log and status-fd output by printing more status change updates
    and actions. Thanks to Ian Jackson.
  * Implement triggers support. Thanks to Ian Jackson.
    Closes: #17243, #68981, #215374, #217622, #248693, #308285

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Add a warning displayed by dpkg-genchanges if the current version is
    smaller than the previous one. Closes: #4655
  * Add -d and -c options in dpkg-checkbuilddeps to override
    build-depends/conflicts. Closes: #114774
  * Include list of libraries in dpkg-gensymbols' warning about new/lost
    libraries.
  * Add -R option to dpkg-buildpackage so that one can replace the usual
    "debian/rules" by something else. Closes: #355654
  * Always list all binary packages in the Description: field of .changes
    files. It's nice for reviewers and mentors.debian.net was using this field
    on source only uploads to display short description of what the package is
    about.
  * Handle the case when the library has a different SONAME than the one used
    to find it. Closes: #462413
  * Fix Dpkg::Version and Dpkg::Fields::Object to import _g() from
    Dpkg::Gettext. Thanks to Adam Heath and Olivier Berger for spotting
    this. Closes: #465651
  * Change PATH during make check to look into build directories containing
    dpkg and the related scripts. Thanks to Mike Frysinger. Closes: #466957
  * Some lintian cleanup:
    - add overrides for some useless I: tags
    - drop unused overrides
    - updated several manual pages to fix hyphen-used-as-minus-sign
    - fixed manpage-has-errors-from-man in several manual pages
    - removed empty debian/dpkg.prerm
  * Removed old upgrade code from dpkg's preinst and postinst which only
    concerns upgrading from dpkg version older than the one in oldstable
    already. And thus we get rid of old the last usage of read in those
    scripts (fixes lintian's warning read-in-maintainer-script).
  * Removed sorting of dependencies in dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-source. But
    kept it for all other fields (Enhances, Conflicts, Replaces, Breaks,
    Build-Conflicts and Build-Conflicts-Indep).
  * Instead changed dpkg-shlibdeps to sort the dependencies generated in
    ${shlibs:*} variables.
  * Changed the logic of simplification of dependencies: if any dependency
    must be discarded due to another dependency appearing further
    in the field, the superseding dependency will take the place of the
    discarded one. Added a test case for this.
  * dpkg-shlibdeps properly accounts usage of symbols provided by private
    libraries without SONAME. Closes: #469838
  * Add a new warning to dpkg-shlibdeps when a library NEEDED is in fact
    not used by any of the binaries analyzed. Closes: #472332
  * Add a new --warnings=<value> option to select the set of warnings to
    activate. By default, do not activate the warning about useless
    libraries at the binary level (instead the new warning above is activated
    by default: it's less strict and more useful).
  * dpkg-source has been heavily refactored to make it easier to support
    multiple source package formats. Several new source package formats have
    been added:
    - the format "2.0" is the original wig&pen
    - the format "3.0 (quilt)" is based on 2.0. It uses a tarball for the
      debian directory and can thus include binary files. Binaries
      outside of the debian directory can be also included if they
      are listed in debian/source/include-binaries (and option
      --include-binaries will generate this file automatically).
      Closes: #4588, #4628
    - thus it will also preserve timestamps on Debian-provided
      documentation like README.Debian. Closes: #366555
    - it handles an explicit series of patches and the patch can thus be
      named without constraints. Patches can contain arbitrary
      headers/comments between file chunks. Closes: #363018
    - it ignores changes on a number of temporary and VCS-specific files
      by default. Closes: #203792, #323909
    - the patches in debian/patches can remove files. Closes: #12564
    - the patches are applied at unpack time. Closes: #463048
    - the formats "3.0 (quilt/native)" don't include VCS directories by
      default. Closes: #435126
    - the format "3.0 (custom)" can be used to create a source package
      containing arbitrary files. It's useful for helper tools that can
      generate the files by themselves in a more efficient way
      (like all the *-buildpackage tools). Closes: #246918
    - the formats "3.0 (git/bzr)" are experimental formats based
      on corresponding VCS repositories. Thanks to Joey Hess and Colin Watson
      respectively.
  * dpkg-source has a new --no-check option. It disables GPG check and
    checksums checks. Closes: #220758
  * dpkg-shlibdeps is now able to look into directories containing libraries
    used by cross-built binaries provided that the right environment variable
    are set. Closes: #453267
  * Change default value of LDFLAGS (set by dpkg-buildpackage) to ''
    instead of '-Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions'. It's safer at this point of the
    release cycle.
  * dpkg-buildpackage will set PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR (but not override an existing
    value) in case of cross-compilation so that pkgconfig finds .pc files
    in the directory specific to the target architecture. Closes: #439979

  [ Frank Lichtenheld ]
  * Add a warning in dpkg-buildpackage if the build-dependencies are not
    satisfied during -S. Closes: #445552
  * Add a missing space in the German scripts translation. Closes: #463398
  * Add improved deb-shlibs.5 manual page by Zack Weinberg. Closes: #466135
  * dpkg-buildpackage exports some build related environment variables
    now. Based on a patch by Matthias Klose. Closes: #465282
    (See dpkg-buildpackage(1) and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DistCompilerFlags
     for details)
  * Add support for use of SHA1 and SHA256 checksums in .dsc and
    .changes files. Information will be available in Checksums-Sha{1,256}
    fields. .changes format version increased to 1.8.
  * Link dselect against libncursesw. Closes: #466321
  * Forward port a patch from the old changelog parser to the new
    one that got lost during the transition. '+' and '.' can now
    be used in distribution names yet again. Reported by dann frazier.

dpkg (1.14.8) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Heavy rework of dpkg-shlibdeps:
    - Support "symbols" files to generate finer-grained dependencies.
      Those files can be created by the new dpkg-gensymbols command.
      Closes: #430367
    - Uses now all paths in RPATH (instead of only the first).
      Closes: #395942
    - Support parsing include directives in /etc/ld.so.conf. Closes: #431597
    - Libraries are also searched in the public directories of packages
      being built and thus debian/shlibs.local can effectively define
      dependencies for libraries that are being built. Closes: #80340
    - "symbols" files use the full SONAME as key instead of splitting it in
      (name, version) like in the "shlibs" format. This allows binaries to
      be linked with unversioned libraries and not fail. Note that
      unversioned libraries are still a very bad idea.  Closes: #48208
    - dpkg-shlibdeps now supports '-x<package>' options that can be used to
      exclude packages from generated dependencies (use with care though).
      Closes: #41907, #109954
    - If dpkg-shlibdeps doesn't find any dependency information for a
      shared library that is actively used, then it will fail. This can be
      disabled with the option '--ignore-missing-info'. Closes: #10807
  * Switch perl programs to use the new Dpkg::Deps module. This changes the
    behaviour of dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-source which will rewrite and
    simplify dependencies and build dependencies as possible. Multiple
    dependencies on the same package are replaced by their intersection.

dpkg (1.13.12) experimental; urgency=low

  * Due to the changes in dpkg-shlibdeps it is not recommended
    to use this version for building packages intended to be
    uploaded into an official archive, yet.

  [ Frank Lichtenheld ]
  * Update AUTHORS and debian/copyright for new maintainer team.

  * Don't use the ldd output in dpkg-shlibdeps. Search for the
    matching libraries ourself. This fixes problems with both
    symlinked directories, Closes: #103024, #145714, #164020, #285857
    and biarch builds. Closes: #317082
  * Let dpkg-gencontrol bail out with an error if parsedep
    found an error while parsing a dependency field. Closes: #228125
  * dpkg-source -x now tries to chown all files extracted from
    tar files. The temporary directory is now created with mode
    0700, too. Together this should make it safer to run
    dpkg-source -x as root. Based on suggestions by Marcus
    Brinkmann and Colin Watson. Closes: #144571, #238460
  * Let dpkg-source -b check the build relation fields before
    putting them into the .dsc. As a side effect they also
    get normalized. Closes: #254449
  * Check the gpg signatures of .dsc files before unpacking. See
    the upstream changelog for a full description of the semantics.
    Based on a patch by Matt Zimmerman. Closes: #48711
  * Let dpkg-source ensure (as good as possible) that all
    build source packages can also be unpacked.
    Closes: #6820, #7014
    Also fixed handling of md5sum -b output in dpkg-source on
    the way. Based on a patch by Ingo Saitz. Closes: #316123
  * Check for illegal architecture strings in dpkg-gencontrol and
    dpkg-source. dpkg-gencontrol will only issue a warning while
    dpkg-source will error out. Closes: #96920
  * Add support "package types" to dpkg-shlibdeps. Patch by Joey Hess.
    Closes: #335056, #345475
  * Fix man page references to dpkg and dselect man pages. Many
    of them still had a wrong section.
    Closes: #332826
  * Let dpkg-source -b warn about special permissions of files added
    in the diff since these will get lost. Closes: #306125
  * dpkg-source -x didn't work in case the upstream version or
    the Debian version ended with ~. Fixed.

dpkg (1.13.11) unstable; urgency=low
  
  The "Good, clean fun" Release.

  * Fixed the always broken error handling so that only the intended
    cleanup handlers are run, rather than ones that we didn't expect.
    This corrects the bug when a package's postrm fails and the package is
    left in an installed state with no files; the package will now be left
    in a half-installed state, as originally intended.  Found by Marga
    Manterola while documenting the maintainer scripts.  Closes: #296026.
  * Fixed removal of files involved in diversions during upgrade, caused by
    checking whether the "directory" was in use by another package without
    actually checking whether or not it was a directory.  Closes: #310390.
  * Fixed package saving to not disappear packages who divert anything from
    the installing package out of the way.  Closes: #113626.
  * Improved clean-up of unpack failure during install or upgrade, to leave
    the system in exactly the same state as it started in.
    Closes: #47404, #82407, #121173, #170869, #201848, #236733, #268639.
  * Fixed crash when unpacking a package which has an unversioned Replaces
    declared on it by another package previously unpacked in the same run
    (Colin Watson).  Closes: #322595.

  * New install unwinding fixed to ensure we don't leave a version in the
    status db for a not-installed package.
  * Corrected error call when encountering a corrupted filesystem tarfile
    to not print "Success".  Closes: #95570.
  * Fixed castration of potentially unsafe devices to not follow symlinks.
    Closes: #169928.
  * Marked log file descriptor as close-on-exec.  Closes: #320925.
  * Re-worked dpkg-source -x to allow all manner of strange things maintainers
    seem to do, unpacking isn't the right place to enforce sanity; we'll
    do it in -b later on >:-).  Closes: #316470, #317760, #318473, #318745,
    #322359, #322361, #322362.

  * Corrected dselect synopsis line to match consensus.  Closes: #318659.
  * Changed dpkg-name to use a shell redirect rather than the /dev/stderr
    device that may not be writable.  Closes: #318376.
  * Adjusted various dpkg-query options to avoid outputting a trailing
    newline.  Closes: #151651, #319781.
  * Changed references to "statusoverride" file to just "statoverride"
    to make it match reality.  Closes: #320952.
  * Fixed several bugs with the default diff ignore list used by dpkg-source.
  * Added ,,* to the list of default diff ignore list.  Closes: #322917.

  * Fixes to dpkg-dev (Frank Lichtenheld):
    - dpkg-checkbuilddeps will now exit with an error if it is unable to
      parse a dependency field.  Closes: #171762, #302229.
    - dpkg-genchanges will now output a warning if given -sd for a native
      package, as it's going to ignore it.  Closes: #5571.
    - dpkg-source fixed to give a more meaningful error message if given
      a directory as the first argument.  Closes: #306874.
    - dpkg-source fixed to handle being given an absolute path to -b.
      Closes: #147574.

      DEB_*_ARCH_CPU variables that contain the Debian system and CPU
      names respectively.
    - dpkg-architecture outputs (mostly) correct GNU system names now,
      in particular this means that it will output "linux-gnu" instead
      of "linux".  You should use the new _ARCH_OS variables instead.
  * Documentation:

    be redefined to be 64-bit compatible.
  * Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>:
    Fix configure to set HAVE_SETLOCALE.  Closes: #211816
  * "Loïc Le Loarer" <lll_deb@m4x.org>:
    Add a -d|--chdir option to start-stop-daemon.  Closes: #151802
  * Split the background block into 2 parts: one that does the fork, and
    opens /dev/tty and /dev/null, and one that does everything else.  The
    second block is then moved to be run right before the exec.  This
    allows error messages to be seen from the child(previously, they were
    lost), and allows for the chroot to not require the device files.
    These changes based on the bugs filed by:

    Loïc Le Loarer <lll_deb@m4x.org>: Closes: #151800

dpkg (1.10.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * controllib.pl:
    * Rewrote the parsedep stuff, so that it wasn't done during control
      file parsing.  Scripts that need the internal parsed format should
      call parsedep on the field's value.
    * Split the substvars parsing into a separate function.
    * No longer validate dependency fields when reading the control file.
      Some fields may have vars in them, which breaks the validation.
    * dpkg-gencontrol calls substvars after parsing the control file, and
      then validates the substituted depends lines.  Originally,
      substitution occurred only during writing of the final output file.
    * Andreas Barth <aba@not.so.argh.org>:
      Fix bad regex that didn't allow spaces in dependency field parsing.
      It now directly matches what the c code expects.  It previously was
      allowing all of \S, which matched on '('.
      Closes: #211660.
  * Remove stale debug in debian/control that would have broken
    installation on s390.
  * We were calling our own local copy of dpkg-gencontrol, but the
    system-installed copy of dpkg-shlibdeps.  Now, both are called from
    the build directory.

dpkg (1.10.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg no longer provides any BYHAND files.  If you need the source
    tarball, use the orig.tar.gz file available in the pool.  The
    precompiled tars were hold-overs from when debs were not standard
    ar/tar files.
  * Install /usr/share/doc/dpkg/pseudo-tags, which talks about the bug
    titling we use to mark bugs for filtering in the Debian bts.

    0.12.1-3.
  * Updated config.sub and config.guess in cvs.
  * Change use of strncpy in parsedb to memcpy.  Closes: #160447
  * No longer generate helpmsgs.{cc,h}.
  * several controllib changes:
    * Moved dependency parsing logic from dpkg-checkbuilddeps.
      The dpkg-checkbuilddeps parser didn't support empty fields, while
      the controllib parser did.
    * All dependency fields parsed by controllib.pl support [arch]
      specifiers.  If the arch specifier doesn't apply for the current
      arch, then the item will not be added to the internal list structure.
    * Comment lines(that begin with '#') are removed during parsing.
    * Store the original casing of field names, for use in error reporting.
    * Store the original field's casing with 'o:' prepended in %fi.
      * ballombe@merulo.debian.org:
        dpkg-checkbuilddeps now handles empty fields.  Closes: #111562

dpkg (1.9.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change policy of handling dscformat in dpkg-source
  * Fix the arglist construction for maintainer scripts
  * Revert dscformat to 1.0 since older dpkg-source versions do not have
    the new policy. In the future (starting at format 2.0 to maintain
    compatibility with old dpkg-source implementations) minor changes to
    the dscformat have to be fully backward and forward compatible.

 -- Adam Heath <doogie@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Jun 2001 02:22:40 -0500

dpkg (1.9.13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a -W option to dpkg-source(and the other utils, where it is just
    passed thru), to turn certain errors into warnings(of which, only
    one is changed, namely, the 'tar doesn't contain preceding directory'
    error).  Closes: #101813, and partially 101845.
  * Don't error out if the files in the tar have leading './', for
    dpkg-source.  (another partial close of 101845).
  * Handle the case where a single directory exists in the orig.tar.gz, but
    it is NOT of the form <pkg>-<ver>.  Closes: #101845.
  * Set LC_ALL in dpkg-source when we call external programs when we are
    going to parse their output.  Another bug from 101845.
  * Handle stating of truncated cpio filenames(100 char limit, bah), in
    dpkg-source.  Another bug from 101845.
  * Add support for an Uploaders field, which is read from the first
    paragraph of debian/control, and propagated to the .dsc.  This lists
    the people allowed to upload a package.  If it is not set, then the
    value of the Maintainer is placed into this field of the .dsc.  This
    bumps the .dsc format to 1.1.  Closes: #101815.
  * Handle symlinks in the tarball, and don't error out if found.
  * in controllib, make warnerrors default to warnings.  Affects
    dpkg-source.  This will be changed to be errors in the future.

    dpkg-architecture. Closes: #99874.
  * The internal pod docs in dpkg-architecture were updated to reflect
    that -f was no longer implied when -q was given, but the build system
    wasn't generating new documentation.  Closes: #100997.

    * set LANG to C before execing cpio, as we parse its output.

    * Improve the output parsing of tar in checktarsane().
  * warn instead of die when find returns an error(which happens if there
    is a dangling symlink, because we use -follow).  Closes: #51479.
  * Change list of allowed urgencies in debian/changelog to: low, medium,
    high, and critcial.  Closes: #94475.

  * Things should mostly work OpenBSD 2.8 as well now
  * Added a --status-pipe option.
  * Fixed several memleaks.
  * Profiled dpkg.
    * Reworked lib/parse.c:parsedb().  Instead of using getc(), then
      calling varbufaddc(), it now reads the entire file at once into a
      huge buffer, then moves pointers around, to do the parsing.  This
      gave a speedup of 33% on a dual celeron 333, when reading status and
      available.
    * various other speedups.
  * Removed all --smallmem code, as smallmem and largemem now actually

    it was already broken when there was no gcc anyway :)
  * Fixed missing mipseb that was supposed to be in the archtable
  * Better output in update-alternatives --config, now shows the
    current, and the preferred choices.
  * dpkg-name: ignore epoch when getting version
  * 50dpkg-dev.el: add it as a conffile for dpkg-dev
  * internals.sgml: Removed references to the versions of build tools,
    they date the document.
  * debian-changelog-mode.el: added hint for better log-email handling
  * Added recognition for new source-depends fields for policy
    referenced in bug #41232
  * dpkg-buildpackage: add -ap option to force a pause prior to starting
    the sign process. This helps for people who don't keep their signatures
    on the filesystem (on a floppy perhaps, then mount as needed).
  * minor script corrections
  * dpkg-dev control: Change gcc to c-compiler in the recommends field, and
    move cpio, patch and make to the depends line
  * Leave file info intact in available when installing packages. MD5sum,
    Filename, and MSDOS-Filename used to get lost when installing a
    package.
  * Added armv4l to archtable
  * Added 'D' to the list of choices for conffile handling, closes: #48137
  * Converted internals.sgml to debiandoc format. Also added a dpkg-doc
    package that contains the generated output from this file (.ps, .html
    and .info), includes doc-base support. Internals.sgml is also not
    generated on the binary-arch target, and is no longer "byhand"
  * dpkg-gencontrol: add "Source" to the fields placed in the control file
  * dpkg-parsechangelog: fixed loop for parsepath (#48526)
  * main/{processarc.c,depcon.c}: added new structure for conflictors,
    which contains a struct for conflicts. This is used to create an array
    of conflicting packages, which are going to be replaced. Allows for
    multiple conflicts and replaces. All conflictor handlers were
    converted to loops to handle each one (processarc.c).
  * dpkg-divert: Fix check for writable filesystem, closes: #48646

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Oct 1999 00:39:24 -0400

dpkg (1.4.1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for long filenames, along with --assert-longfilenames
  * Added --chuid option to start-stop-daemon to allow switching to
    a different uid when starting a process
  * Add mipseb and mipsel to the archtable too, since mips and mipseb are
    both viable names for the mips big endian arch, and mipsel is also needed
  * Update dpkg-architecure's archtable
  * Added --config option to update-alternatives to allow easy changing
    of the registered alternatives for a specific name
  * Updated the deb-control(5) man page with all the current fields
    and uses
  * Made the large info screen show 5 lines of the pkglist so that
    it scrolled properly, and still showed the cursor in dselect
  * Removed references to dpkg(5) which seems to not exist anymore
  * Fixed `dpkg-deb --help' and dpkg-deb(1) from reporting --no-check
    when it's actually --nocheck (went with the hardcoded option, so
    this is just a documentation fix).
  * Added better check in disk.setup for a working NFS server. Makes
    it compatible with other non-Linux servers.
  * Corrected dpkg(8)'s example of using dpkg -i (showed it used with
    a .tar.gz instead of a .deb)
  * Applied patch to correct improper TMPDIR handling in dpkg-deb
  * When encountering an error in extracting the tar archives in the
    packages, we should abort the install, not simply give an error
    and continue.
  * Make dpkg give the builtin arch if there was an error while exec()'ing
    the C compiler with --print-architecture. We still fail if the
    output from gcc was bad in some way, since they may be of importance.
  * Removed the maintainer-configure portion in debian/rules, since
    we should be shipping the source with all the auto* stuff
    already generated anyway
  * Removed the ltconfig patch, and resort to a debian/rules fix
    to libtool itself after running configure
  * Removed shlibs.default.i386. It's now a template for arch porting to
    Debian/dpkg, we install it still, if there exists a file matching the
    arch
  * Reimplemented a better *stat cache for the removal checking code,
    this helps a lot when doing upgrades where the packages are a lot
    different in layout
  * Increased largemem auto detection to >= 24megs, since it's not uncommon
    for dpkg to actually use 16megs of ram all on its own when using the
    largemem setting (old minimum was 16megs)
  * debian/rules: chmod -x everything in /usr/lib to make lintian happy.
    in the clean phase just rm -rf $(BUILD), we don't need to run
    distclean and all that other stuff. Don't run "make dist", we
    simply copy the .tar.gz that dpkg-source creates for the byhand
    source.
  * Make start-stop-daemon exit(1) when we don't find one of the
    pid's we are trying to kill, in accordance with the man page.
  * When running --configure on an already installed package, just
    say it's installed, and not that it is in an unconfigurable
    state
  * Fixed some compiler warnings
  * Make dpkg check for uid 0 requirement, before checking the path
    since not being root, is probably the reason that the PATH is
    borked in the first place
  * Make -p short for --print-avail, and -P short for --purge
  * Fix typo in md5sum(1) man page
  * start-stop-daemon: Add --background and --make-pidfile options
  * update-alternatives: make sure we remove "old" symlinks when they
    are no longer pertinent. Add /etc/alternatives/README that refers
    to the update-alternatives(8) man page.
  * dpkg-divert: Add check for being able to write to the old/new
    destination before doing a rename. We fail on this, without
    changing the diversion registry
  * Fix bad regex in update-rc.d

dpkg (1.4.0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added gpg (GNU Privacy Guard) support:
    * scripts/buildpackage.sh: default to GPG (unless no GPG, but only a PGP
      secret key file is found), as GPG, unlike PGP, is DFSG-free.
    * Updated dpkg-source(1), and added gpg(1) and pgp(1) to the SEE ALSO
      section.
    * Worked around broken textmode implementation in GPG.

  * No longer includes developer-keys.pgp . Instead, dpkg now Suggests: and
    dpkg-dev now Recommends: developer-keyring.
  * Compiled with latest libstdc++ (2.9).

dpkg (1.4.0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  
  * Add the requested -nc option to dpkg-buildpackage (Do
    not clean source tree, useful in debugging cycles).
  * controllib.pl: Again by popular acclamation, fix the getlogin() warnings.
    I redirected STDERR onto fd 0 before calling getlogin().
  * tools.m4: Fix display of whether c++ works.
  * dpkg-deb/extract.c: glibc 2.1 and some kernels want to make
    fflush() move the current fpos.  Until someone can fix that,
    protect with seek.
  * Add an extra 0, to dselect/{pkg,meth}keys.cc so it compiles again.
  * Start using lchown() if available.
  * Really fix #20353. (aclocal.m4 was the wrong place; that's a generated
    file.  The correct place is in tl_canon.m4.)

    now provided by the separate "packaging-manual" package.

  * aclocal.m4: applied patch from Joel Klecker <jk@espy.org> to handle
    egcs' --print-libgcc-file-name output. [#20353]
  
  * debian/copyright: correct FSF address.
  * debian/rules: add code from lesstif's debian/rules to make libtool
    less of a fool (i.e. not use -rpath and to link shared libraries
    against libraries it depends on).  Code by Richard Braakman
    <dark@xs4all.nl> and Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>.
  * debian/rules: remove all reference to the packaging manual as it is
    now provided by the separate "packaging-manual" package. [#21581,
    #21186, #22698, #23342]
  * debian/rules: link dpkg-divert.1.gz to undocumented.7.gz as the lack
    of a real manpage has been reported in #11093.
  * debian/README.compile: removed gawk and bogus comment about gettext
    being in experimental, as reported by Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es>

    create new subdirectories.  dpkg-source -x now warns (previously gave
    error) if maintainer changes create new subdirectories (partially
    fixes #6866, #6671, #5045, #6482).

    dpkg-buildpackage to choose PGP key based on Maintainer: field of 
    package being built (or -m<maintainer> option, if present) (fixes 
    #7898).
  * Changed controllib.pl to use $ENV{LOGNAME}, getlogin(), and $<
    (in that order) to determine the intended ownership of 
    debian/{files,substvars},  (fixes #7324, #6823, #5659, #5965, #5929,
    #9239, #5366).
  * Don't sign .dsc file in dpkg-buildpackage if building a binary-only
    release (fixes #7260).

    a separate flag.
  * Epochs in version numbers implemented, using the syntax
    <epoch>:<version>-<revision>.  (Epoch not usually displayed.)

    installation architecture, and looks in the right part of the tree).

  * dselect disk method doesn't try to satisfy the predependencies of
    packages which are on hold.

  * Fixed missing space in version syntax error messages.
  * Manpage dpkg.8 installed with warning about inaccuracy.

  * new dpkg options --yet-to-unpack, --merge-avail and --update-avail.
  * dpkg -G is an abbreviation for dpkg --refuse-downgrade.
  * dpkg -R alias for --root withdrawn, pending reuse with different meaning.
  * dpkg --help message rationalised somewhat.

  * Obsolete `examples' and `dpkg-split' directories removed from
    source tree.  The `hello' package is a better example.

dpkg (0.93.67) BETA; priority=LOW for C dpkg alpha testers, HIGH for others

  * dpkg no longer statically linked and -g.
  * calls to abort() changed to print string, file and line number first.
  * removed unused variable from dpkg source.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 4 Aug 1995 01:39:52 +0100

dpkg (0.93.66) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg will correctly remove overwritten files from the lists of
    the package(s) that used to contain them.

  * dpkg --purge is now an action, rather than a modifier for --remove,
    and the -P alias for it is withdrawn.

  * dpkg --unpack/--install filenames in messages are now more sensible
    about when to use .../ (show as many trailing components as possible
    in 40 characters, or the whole path if that the last component is
    longer than that).

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Thu, 3 Aug 1995 02:11:03 +0100

dpkg (0.93.65) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg --remove should, when a package being removed is depended-on
    by another that is also queued for removal, defer the depended-on
    package rather than aborting it.  (Bug#1188.)

  * dpkg will not attempt to configure or remove a package more than
    once in the same run.  (Bug#1169.)

  * dpkg cosmetic fix to dependency problems message (this bug
    hasn't been triggered to my knowledge).

  * perl-dpkg no longer installed in /usr/bin.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Wed, 2 Aug 1995 13:02:58 +0100

dpkg (0.93.64) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg marks a package as no longer `to be configured in this run'
    when an error occurs, so that other packages which depend on it
    will fail (rather than causing a loop and an assertion failure,
     packages.c:166: failed assertion `dependtry <= 4').

  * dselect initial selection granularity is single-package.
  * dpkg --no-also-select option renamed to --selected-only (old option
    still accepted, but no longer in --help).  Changed -N to -O.

  * dselect `update' option changed to `install' (and other options
    renamed too).  NB: old access methods will not work, because
    the `update' script should now be an `install' script.

  * dselect `installation methods' renamed to `access methods'.
  * dpkg --skip-same-version and --refuse-downgrade produce friendlier
    messages when they skip packages.
  * --licence option now properly mentioned in all programs' --version
    messages.

  * bad fix for ELF compile problem involving myopt.h removed (compile
    problem turned out to be a GCC bug.)

dpkg (0.93.63) ALPHA; priority=LOW

  * preinst works around shell bug/misfeature involving `trap'.

  * dpkg --skip-same-version doesn't skip packages which have
    an error flag set or which aren't in a standard `installed' state.

  * dpkg --search now does a substring search if the string doesn't
    start with a wildcard character (*, [ or ?) or slash.

  * problem with C/C++ linkage of stuff in "myopt.h" fixed, to help
    with compiling with GCC 2.7.0.

  * dselect Makefile.in `clean' deletes curkeys.inc &c, so that they are
    not shipped in the distribution source and will be rebuilt on the
    target system.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Thu, 27 Jul 1995 13:38:47 +0100

dpkg (0.93.62) ALPHA; priority=HIGH

  * dpkg purges leftover control scripts from /var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci,
    rather than associating them with the wrong package.  (Bug#1101.)

  * dpkg won't `disappear' packages containing no files or directories,
    nor a package required for depends/recommended.  (Bug#1128.)

  * dpkg follows directory symlinks.  (Bug#1125.)

  * dselect fixups for ELF/GCC2.7.0 compilation.

  * Some cleanups to fix mistakes discovered by ELF-GCC 2.7.0, and fixup
    for newer C++ draft standard (`for' variable declaration scope change).

dpkg (0.93.60) ALPHA; priority=HIGH

  * dpkg doesn't think packages have `disappeared' if you install
    several packages at once.  (later reported as Bug#1132.)

  * usage error messages tidied up.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Sun, 16 Jul 1995 17:56:56 +0100

dpkg (0.93.59) ALPHA; priority=HIGH

  * dpkg doesn't break maintainer scripts &c if package `foo' exists

  * dpkg implements `disappear' functionality.
  * dpkg/dselect remove dead entries from /var/lib/dpkg/status.

  * dpkg --list now sorted correctly and output somewhat improved.

    encountered in the `available' file so far.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 14 Jul 1995 20:19:21 +0100

dpkg (0.93.57) ALPHA; priority=LOW

  * dpkg does chroot when running maintainer scripts (--instdir
    should work right now, though I haven't been able to test it).

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 14 Jul 1995 01:32:30 +0100

dpkg (0.93.56) ALPHA; priority=HIGH

  * dpkg can now overwrite symlinks to directories, and will
    do correct handling of symlinks to plain files.
  * dpkg should not replace any directory with a symlink.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Thu, 13 Jul 1995 02:43:36 +0100

dpkg (0.93.54) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg and dselect no longer throw away all Class and Section
    information in /var/lib/dpkg/available.  (Oops.)

dpkg (0.93.39) BETA; priority=LOW

  * dselect can now:
    - allow you to select and configure an installation method;
    - invoke installation method scripts to update the available file
      and unpack packages;
    - invoke dpkg to configure and remove packages.
    There are no installation methods available yet.

  * Search feature in dselect works (it was purely an ncurses bug).

  * dpkg-*.nondebbin.tar.gz now available (built by debian.rules).

  * The target directory for dpkg-deb --extract (also available as
    dpkg --extract) is no longer optional.  dpkg-deb suggests the use

  * Revised function attribute support checking in configure script.
  * Removed obsolete `dselect.pl' from scripts directory.
  * New option --licence on all the C programs.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Sun, 14 May 1995 18:05:38 +0100

dpkg (0.93.38) BETA; priority=MEDIUM

    for `package_revision' and writes the former.

  * Major improvements and many changes to C option parsing, database
    management, error handling, Makefiles &c to support dpkg.
  * dpkg-deb should now work if sizeof(void*) < sizeof(void(*)()).

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Mon, 24 Apr 1995 12:34:39 +0100

dpkg (0.93.37) BETA; priority=LOW (MEDIUM for dselect users)

  * Fixed segfault if no description available (Bug#735);
    thanks to Peter Tobias for the bug report.
  * Fixed other assorted minor bugs in description displays.

  * Changed dpkg-deb --info short option from -i to -I, to make

    dpkg-deb for backwards compatibility).

  * Produce more sensible error when main package list is empty.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 7 Apr 1995 02:24:55 +0100

dpkg (0.93.36) BETA; priority=LOW (MEDIUM for dselect users)

  * All the C code (including dselect) updated to support `provides'
    (virtual packages).
  * Revamped dselect's related package selection/deselection
    algorithms.

    as the predefined ones which we understand and can interpret).
  * Fixed bug that prevented display update when moving down a small
    recursive package list in dselect.
  * Column heading characters corrected from `SHOC' to `HSOC'.

 * Improved dselect's package list help messages.
 * Highlight now moves on after (de)selecting just one package.
 * Better algorithm for scrolling up/down when moving highlight.
 * Fixed bug in display of `preformatted' extended Description lines.
   (dselect is still ALPHA, but is fairly stable.)

   exist, and when selecting or skipping a package that isn't
   currently selected (during unpack processing).

Mon, 27 Mar 1995 03:30:51 BST  Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

	* dpkg (0.93.32): Alpha dselect released and installed in
	                  /usr/sbin/dselect.
	* dpkg (0.93.32): Many portability enhancements: should now
	                  compile using GCC 2.6.3, and dpkg-deb should
	                  compile better on non-Linux systems.

	                  just for input buffers.
	* dpkg (0.93.32): varbuf has C++ member functions in header
	                  #ifdef __cplusplus.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.31:

* start-stop-daemon --pidfile now works (Bug#571).
* Fixed dependency processing bugs which could require a rerun of
  dpkg --configure (Bug#566).

Changes in dpkg 0.93.09:

* Made postinst scripts really be run when dpkg --purge used.
* Added new --force-extractfail option - VERY DANGEROUS.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.28:

* Make version number specifications in Depends &c work.
* Added AC_PROG_CXX to autoconf.in for dselect.
* Changed myopt.h not to have cipaction field in cmdinfo (this was
  specially for dpkg-deb) - now we have a generic void*.
* Renamed `class' member of `pkginfoperfile' to `clas' [sic].
* Much work in `dselect' subdirectory.
* Deleted executables, objects and libraries from OLD tree !
* Minor changes to various copyright notices and top-of-file comments.
* Don't install nasty Perl dselectish thing as /usr/bin/dselect.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.26:

* Added --no-also-select instead of not auto-selecting on --unpack
  but doing so on --install; removed --force-unpack-any.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.25:

* Fixed duplicate output (failure to flush before fork) bug.
* More clarification of md5sum.c copyright.
* Corrected typo in ChangeLog in 0.93.24 source package.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.24:

* dpkg could copy conffiles info from one package to another.  Aargh.
  Bug #426.
* dpkg failed to initialise status if you tried to remove or
  configure a nonexistent package.  Bug #419.
* install-info now handles START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY entries like:
   * Gdb::                         The GNU debugger.
  Previously it would only accept (Bug #407):
   * Gdb: (gdb).                   The GNU debugger.
* When installing a new foo.info[.gz], install-info now replaces
   * Foo: (foo.info).              The Gnoo Foo.

* Assorted minor source code rearrangements.
* Fixed assorted copyright notices, clarified md5sum copyright.
* Corrected typo in 0.93.23 source package's ChangeLog.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.23:

* `dpkg-deb' --build now does a syntax check on the control file.
* `dselect' is now no longer called `debian', spurious copy removed
  from package top-level source directory.
* C control information parsing complete and somewhat tested.
* Moved `global' include files into $(srcdir)/include from ../lib,
  added some files to the lib Makefile, and arranged for pop_cleanup().

Changes in dpkg 0.93.22:

* Fixed bug which caused dpkg to see failures of md5sum where there
  were none (would also have caused dpkg to miss a real failure).
* Fixed failure to update some `status' database fields.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.21:

* Fixed error-handling bug which could corrupt database.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.20:

* Fixed bug which ran old (/var/adm/dpkg) postinst scripts.
* Fixed dpkg usage message which claimed -i => both --install & --info.
* Use Colin Plumb's MD5 code - faster, and better copyright.
* Manpages: dpkg-deb(8), deb-control(5), deb(5) - thanks to Raul
  Deluth Miller.  Also, an xfig picture of some C program innards.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.19:

* Don't delete the `list' file from the dpkg database.
* Fixed various bugs in the conffile handling.
* Conffiles that are symlinks will now be treated as if the
  `dereferenced' name of the file was listed in conffiles.  This means
  that /etc/foo -> /usr/etc/foo will cause all conffile updates of
  /etc/foo to create /usr/etc/foo.dpkg-tmp &c instead.  However, the
  link will be removed if --purge is used to delete all the conffiles.
* When doing a new installation, or when updating a conffile that
  wasn't listed as a conffile in the old version of the package, don't
  do any prompting but just install the version from the archive.
* Corrected error message if exec of dpkg --vextract failed
  and --instroot or --root specified.
* Added new --force-unpack-any option.
* Extra newline after --status output.
* Added -W options to CFLAGS.
* Fixed mistake in previous ChangeLog entry.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.18:

* Fixed invocation of dpkg-deb --vextract if --root or --instdir
  not specified.
* Create /var/lib/dpkg/updates.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.17:

* install-info --remove exits with status 0 if it doesn't find the
  thing to remove, instead of status 1.
* Error handling functions have __attribute__((format...)) if GCC.
* push_cleanup its arg takes void **argv instead of char **argv.
* Top-level Makefile.in has set -e before `for' loops.
* dpkg-deb --info not-an-existing-file produces fewer error messages.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.16:

* Made --root= option really extract to $instroot instead of `/'.
* install-info clears the 0444 bits in its umask.
* Fixed a few database handling bugs which cause dpkg always to fail,
  and usually to corrupt the status database in various ways.
* dpkg-deb completely rewritten, now doesn't tinker with
  /var/{adm,lib}/dpkg.  Should be faster.
* Directory structure and Makefiles in source package reorganised.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.15:

* Added `debian' (dselect), still very primitive.
* Database format changed, and moved from /var/adm to /var/lib.
* Added dpkg --avail mode, --list, --status and --search.
* Set of dpkg => dpkg-deb pass-through operations changed (but
  dpkg-deb not yet updated).
* Added --root, --admindir and --instdir, as well as --isok &c.
* Moved much stuff into /usr/lib/dpkg-lib.pl, rewritten status
  database handling.
* Put packages in `purge' state even if `deinstall' requested if
  they have no postrm and no conffiles.
* Version number comparisons fixed.
* insert-version.pl now installes lib.pl filename too.
* Strip trailing slashes when reading files from file lists.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.14:

* Fixed parsing of DEPENDS &c fields with trailing whitespace.
* postinst now fixes up broken ispell.control file.
* Cyclic dependency/multiple package removal processing: don't consider
  packages we've just removed when looking for a reason not to go ahead.
* Added call to postinst with `purge' argument for expunging old
  configuration etc. that aren't listed in conffiles.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.13:

* sub S_ISREG defined in dpkg.pl.
* Checking of DEPENDS &c fields was too lax, causing an internal error
  if you fed it certain kinds of broken control file.

Mon Nov 28 02:00:13 GMT 1994  Ian Jackson  <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

        * dpkg 0.93.10 released.

        * dpkg.pl completely rewritten.

        * dpkg-deb: removed dabase-processing and --install option.

        * Makefiles reworked, debian.rules added.

        * Don't install anything in /usr/doc/examples.

        * dpkg-*.deb contains /usr/bin/dpkg-deb.dist, fixed up by postinst.

Thu Oct 20 13:22:20 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.9 released.

        * dpkg.pl: Use $argument, not $package, with `--build'.
        Make sure that saved postinst scripts are executable.

Tue Oct 18 09:40:57 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.8 released.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Do not report an error from rmdir ()
        when `errno' is ENOTEMPTY (Directory not empty), because in this
        case we have found the highest-level directory in the package and
        are ready to exit the loop (i.e., it is a normal occurrence).

Mon Oct 17 10:44:32 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * Makefile.in: Adapted all Makefiles to the GNU Coding Standards.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Make sure that parent directories are
        removed LAST!  This will result in complete removal of packages
        when --remove is called.  dpkg 0.93.7 (and earlier) had problems
        with this because it tried to remove directories in order, which
        will work most of the time, but not necessarily all of the time.

        * deb/list.c (pkg_list): Output is sorted by package name.

Tue Oct  4 12:27:10 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): When a list file cannot be
        opened, silently fail and let the front-end explain the problem.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): When a control file cannot be opened,
        silently fail and let the front-end explain the problem.

        * deb/search.c (pkg_search): Exit 0 if the regular expression is
        matched and 1 if it is not.

Mon Oct  3 18:38:53 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg.pl: New file.  Replaces dpkg.sh.

        * deb/Makefile.in: Renamed `dpkg-util.deb' to `dpkg-deb'.

        * deb/build.c (pkg_build): `--build' is less verbose, instead
        letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_install): Ditto.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Ditto.

        * deb/search.c (pkg_search): Ditto.

        * deb/describe.c (pkg_describe): `--describe' is less verbose,
        instead letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.
        The ``Description:'' label has been removed.

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): `--version' is less verbose,
        instead letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.
        The ``Version:'' label has been removed, as has the maintainer
        information.

Mon Sep 12 14:22:04 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): `--version' now reports the
        version number of dpkg if no argument is specified.

Thu Sep  1 13:31:37 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.7 released.

        * deb/build.c (pkg_build): check status and exit if non-zero.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): ditto.

        * deb/install.c (archive_extract): ditto.

Thu Sep  1 13:20:08 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): indent to the same point as
        pkg_describe.

Thu Sep  1 12:21:11 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * Makefile.in (dist): added debian.rules binary, source and
        dist targets to make final distribution easier to make.
        (install): install programs to /usr/bin.

        * deb/Makefile.in (install): install programs to /usr/bin.

        * deb/list.c (pkg_list): enforce a maximum limit of ten characters
        for the package name in the output.
        (pkg_list): left-justify the version number to make it easier for
        the front-end to parse the output.
        (pkg_list): replace first '\n' character in packages[n].description
        with '\0'.

        * deb/install.c (archive_extract): use the `p' option to `tar' to
        ensure that permissions are preserved.

Sat Aug 27 09:53:37 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.6 released.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): only unlink CONTROL if ARCHIVE_FLAG is
        true!

Fri Aug 26 15:38:22 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.5 released.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): merged function archive_contents
        into function pkg_contents.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): use lstat (rather than stat) so
        that symbolic links are recognized.
        (pkg_contents): print the usual `<path> -> <link_to>' now that we
        recognize symbolic links.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): create a FIFO to pipe the needed
        information to the ``formatter'' rather than creating a directory
        in /tmp for the package information, which is what we used to do.

Thu Aug 25 11:46:27 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * lib/fake-ls.c (mk_date_string): return a pointer to malloc'ed
        area.
        (mk_mode_string): ditto.

        * dpkg.sh: make sure the control information is extracted to a
        uniquely-named temporary directory during package installation.

        * dpkg.sh: execute the pre- and post-removal scripts during
        package removal.

        * dpkg.sh: exit immediately if dpkg-util.deb reports failure.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_control): make sure that `package' exists and
        is a Debian archive before doing anything.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_extract): make sure that `package' exists and
        is a Debian archive before doing anything.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_install): unlink `extract_output' when done.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): use lstat (rather than stat) so that
        --remove does not get confused and think that a symbolic link to a
        directory is actually a directory, which results in the symbolic
        link never being removed at all.

ChangeLog begins Thu Aug 25 11:46:27 1994 for dpkg 0.93.5.
